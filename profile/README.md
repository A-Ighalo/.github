# Open Source powers JPMorgan Chase

## Welcome to our project repos

Here you will find JPMC open source projects that our developers have incubated and brought to the open source community. 

JPMC has a long history of building sucessful open source projects, forging open standards, and contributing to the  open source community at large. 

From [Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMPQ)](https://www.amqp.org/)- an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organization, and more recently [Quorum](https://consensys.net/quorum/products/) - an open-source protocol layer that enables enterprises to leverage Ethereum for their private or public production blockchain applications (acquired by ConsenSys in Aug-2020), and our most recent projects here.

At our GitHub you will find our current JPMC sponsored projects and an active pipeline of projects that we plan to bring to the community.
